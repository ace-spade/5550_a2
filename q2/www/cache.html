<body><p>Browser cache is data saved from a site onto the computer's hard drive for the browser to use when the site is reloaded.
Cache is used because the read speeds of drives are considerably faster than over internet, decreasing load times for commonly used sites.
Resetting cache treats the computer as a new user entering the page for the first time.
Because the site will only load the popup on the first page load, deleting the cache must be done to see the prompt again.
